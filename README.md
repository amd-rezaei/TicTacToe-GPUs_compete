## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **CUDA Toolkit** (Tested with CUDA 12.6 or later)
- **NVIDIA GPU** with the proper driver installed

### 🖥 Compilation
Navigate to the project directory and compile the code using:

```bash
nvcc -o tic_tac_toe game.cu
```

### 🕹 Execution
To run the game with a default 3x3 board:

```bash
./tic_tac_toe
```

To run with a custom square board size, such as 4x4:

```bash
./tic_tac_toe 4
```

### 🖼 Example Output
Here’s how the game looks:

#### 4x4 Board - Initial Moves

### 🛠 Customization
The game logic allows you to adjust the board size. Simply pass the desired size as a command-line argument.

### ⚠ Known Issues
Ensure the board size is appropriate for the game. The win condition is tied to the number of rows and columns.

### 🔍 Debugging
The game includes detailed debugging output to help understand the internal game logic.
