# cudamultigpu_TicTacToe-
This project is a CUDA-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game, where two AI players compete against each other using different strategies. The game is designed to run on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA programming model. It demonstrates the use of basic AI strategies and GPU computation to manage game state and determine player moves.
